# EPQ-project
This contains every piece of code that I have written for my EPQ project, whether it is a beta of the final code, some testing or simply me doing some random code practice
Every single piece of code will be written in python 3.12, so to see the code in action, a python interpreter needs to be installed

Below are the explanation for every piece of code:

- Genetic_algorithm_beta_1.py:
My first attempt at creating a programme that adapts to the surroundings, which is made trivial through me giving a very simple environment of a quadratic equation. I created this in order to have a general feel for the final project, and to understand the basis of genetic algorithm.
